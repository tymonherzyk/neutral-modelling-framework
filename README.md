# neutral-modelling-framework
## Introduction
This framework was developed to facilitate the research presented in the thesis: "Towards a general theory within wastewater treatment: computational and experimental examples utilising fundamental laws to describe microbial community structure in wastewater treatment systems" written by Tymon Alexander Herzyk, submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Civil Engineering, at the School of Engineering, College of Science and Engineering, University of Glasgow. The framework developed is shared here under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY) to offer transparency and allow others to make use of the framework developed for further research.

The framework is split into three packages simulation, sampling and fitting. Code for each of these packages is provided in respective folders and descriptions of how each package operates is provided in relative README.md files. Instalation, user and developer guides are provided in the Guides folder. 

## Aim
The framework was tasked with producing relative abundance time series under different sampling regimes from differing sets of community structuring processes and with facilitating the calibration of common neutral models to these data sets with the purpose of producing estimates for distinct model parameters. The framework is made up of three packages, a simulation package, a sampling package and a fitting package. All scripts and functions within these packages were written using MATLAB version R2020b in accordance with the academic license provided by the University of Glasgow. Storage of user variables for the operation of these packages is achieved through spreadsheets. Output and log files are stored as MATLAB files. Full code for all scripts and functions developed can be found within the appendices.

## Framework architecture
The figure below lays out the overall architecture of the framework developed. The three dashed boxes indicate the remit of each package, the primary executable for each package is highlighted in the centre of these boxes. Pathways or files outwith the dashed boxes represent areas where user interaction is required. The movement of information within the framework is depicted using solid arrows, file names and types are indicated by coloured tags and key variables are portrayed through relevant abbreviations contained in clear tags. User input variables, required for the operation of each package, are stored in associated spreadsheets, within figure \ref{framework_architecture} these are represented by files simulationParameters.xlsx, samplingParameters.xlsx and fittingParameters.xlsx.
