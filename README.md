# neutral-modelling-framework
The figure below lays out the overall architecture of the framework developed. The three dashed boxes indicate the remit of each package, the primary executable for each package is highlighted in the centre of these boxes. Pathways or files outwith the dashed boxes represent areas where user interaction is required. The movement of information within the framework is depicted using solid arrows, file names and types are indicated by coloured tags and key variables are portrayed through relevant abbreviations contained in clear tags. User input variables, required for the operation of each package, are stored in associated spreadsheets, within figure \ref{framework_architecture} these are represented by files simulationParameters.xlsx, samplingParameters.xlsx and fittingParameters.xlsx.
